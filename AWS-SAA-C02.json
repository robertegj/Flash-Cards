        "False, elastic IP stays but public IP will change"}, 
    { "Quick Start Amazon Machine Image (AMI) can create any instance type":
        "Yup, any EC2 instance type"},
    { "What S3 encryption doesn't require AWS storing the key to encrypt/decrypt data?":

        "STS except in US-EAST"}, 
    { "What alerts you to malware?":
        "GuardDuty"}, 
    { "Versioning creates new instance for encrypt/decrypt changes":
        "Yup, and the old unencrypted versions will be kept."}, 
    { "Which instance type will continue to cost if left on/unused?":
        "On demand costs $ when used. Reserved costs the same regardless of usage. Spot price is limited by price in advance. "},

        "True - Any EBS volume can be snapshotted"}, 
    { "What AWS service is fastest to spin up a web server?":

        "False"},
    {"How might you allow devs to provision EC2 instances without manually configuring and launching the necessary infrastructure each time?":
        "Elastic Beanstalk takes care of deployments. Lambda can respond to events by running code once. Auto scaling responds to demand."},
    {"Some users in remote geographic locations are experiencing access delays. What service might help?":
        "CloudFront maintains a network of endpoints with caches for your applications."},
    {"What's a good use case for Elastic Block Store?":

    {"What AWS services help integrate local user access controls to AWS resources? Pick two.":

    {"What AWS solution provides more speed and flexibility that a closely defined relational database?":
        "DynamoDB provides a NoSQL (nonrelational) database service. Both are good for workloads that can be more efficiently run without the relational schema of SQL database engines (like those, including Aurora, that are offered by RDS). KMS is a tool for generating and managing encryption keys."},
    {"What is the endpoint address for EC2 in Ireland?":
        "EC2 endpoints will always start with an ec2 prefix followed by the region designation (eu-west-1 in the case of Ireland)."},
    {"What is an availability zone?":
        "An availability zone is an isolated physical data center within an AWS region. Regions contain multiple AZs."},
    {"How can you organize instances, configure their network activity, and access control from a single tool?":
        "VPCs are virtualized network environments where you can control the connectivity of your EC2 (and RDS, etc.) infrastructure."},
    {"How can you ensure your EC2 and S3 resources will meet regulatory standards?":
        "There is no AWS Program Compliance tool. The AWS service level agreement tells you the level of service availability you can realistically expect from a particular AWS service. You can use this information when assessing your compliance with external standards. Log records, though they can offer important historical performance metrics, probably wonâ€™t be enough to prove compliance. The AWS Compliance Programs page will show you only which regulatory programs can be satisfied with AWS resources, not whether a particular configuration will meet their demands. "},
    {"What tool lets you access AWS infra from CLI/shell scripts?":
        "The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool for accessing AWS APIs from the command-line shell of your local computer. The AWS SDK is for accessing resources programmatically."},
    {"What plan should you purchase for help with AWS support for both dev and IT team leaders? (multiple teams)":
        "Unlike the Basic and Developer plans (which allow access to a support associate to no or one user, respectively), the Business plan allows multiple team members."}
